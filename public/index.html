    <h2>Seriously?</h2>

    <p>
        Absolutely!
        Putting the kettle on is a stereotypical British reflex in times of crisis.
        What better way to put the week's Brexit news in to perspective than sitting down with a brew?

    <h2>What if I don't drink tea?</h2>

    <p>
        No problem!
        Coffee is fine too.
        Or hot chocolate.
        You could even make toast, or bake a cake!
    </p>

    <h2>So is this a protest?</h2>
    
    <p>
        Maybe!
        Not everyone can attend pro-EU events and protests, especially not on a regular basis, but there's usually a kettle somewhere nearby.
        Hopefully it's also an ideal conversation starter with people who voted to leave the EU but are less sure about how things are turning out.

    <h2>And then?</h2>

    <p>
        The more ambitious plan is to create a noticable spike in demand on the national grid, so try and synchronise kettles each week and turn on as close to 4pm as you can!
        (Hey, it's no more daft than throwing fish in the Thames. And definitely not as daft as Brexit!)

    <h2>And then?</h2>

    <p>
        If it just ends up being a weekly spot of Brexit therapy for a few enthusiasts, that would be great too.
